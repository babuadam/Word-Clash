# Word-Clash
Word clash is a word matching game developed by java and mysql. There are several levels in the game. For playing this game, a player must enter their name. In each level a set of alphabet will be given to the player and they have to make a meaningful English word from them. Playerâ€™s word will be consider as meaningful if there word will matches in database word collection. The scoring is based on the length of the word the player makes. I developed this game by using java and MySQL.
