# Word-Clash
Word clash is a word matching game developed by java and mysql. There are several levels in the game. For playing this game, a player must enter their name. In each level a set of alphabet will be given to the player and they have to make a meaningful English word from them. Player’s word will be consider as meaningful if there word will matches in database word collection. The scoring is based on the length of the word the player makes. The project was developed by using java and MySQL. It was a team project. I developed the graphical user interfaces of the game.
